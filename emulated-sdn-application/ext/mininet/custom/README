This directory should hold configuration files for custom mininets.

See custom_example.py, which loads the default minimal topology.  The advantage of defining a mininet in a separate file is that you then use the --custom option in mn to run the CLI or specific tests with it.

To start up a mininet with the provided custom topology, do:
  sudo mn --custom custom_example.py --topo mytopo
